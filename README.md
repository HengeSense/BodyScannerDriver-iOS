BodyScannerDriver is a portable stress management tool. Built on the iPhone mobile app platform, BodyScannerDriver is a hands-on diaphragmatic breathing exercise. Breathing exercises have been documented to decrease the body's 'fight-or-flight' (stress) response, and help with mood stabilization, anger control, and anxiety management. BodyScannerDriver can be used as a stand-alone stress reduction tool, or can be used in tandem with clinical care directed by a healthcare worker.

Capitalizing on touch-screen technology, a user can record their stress level on a 'visual analogue scale' by simply swiping a small bar to the left or to the right. BodyScannerDriver uses state-of-the-art graphics, animation, narration, and videos to deliver a sophisticated, immersive experience for the user.
